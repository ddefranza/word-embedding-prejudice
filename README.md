# Measuring Prejudice Through Word Embeddings
This tutorial provides an overview of the method used to analyze gender prejudice and stereotypes across 45 languages, as described in the paper "How Language Shapes Prejudice Against Women: An Examination Across 45 World Languages" (DeFranza, Mishra, &amp; Mishra, 2020). 

The methodology described below can be used to reproduce the analysis in the associated paper. Specifically, it will allow researchers to build construct dictionaries, translate these dictionaries across languages, collect pre-trained word embeddings in each language, calculate the similarity between words of interest, and finally, perform statistical tests on the measured similarities. That said, this method can be further generalized to perform semantic analysis in other ways, using different constructs. The authors hope this resource will help encourage other researchers to utilize the method in their work.

The tutorial proceeds as follows:

1. [Building a construct dictionary](#build-dict)
2. Translating dictionaries
3. Collecting pre-trained word embeddings
4. Calculating cosine similarity
5. Perfroming statistical (permutation) tests
